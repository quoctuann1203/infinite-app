# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

- AsyncStorage for local persistence.
- Lodash Debounce for optimized search.
- FlatList with onEndReached for infinite scrolling.

ðŸ›  Project Structure
/infinite-app
â”œâ”€â”€ /components # Reusable UI components (ProductList, SearchBar, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ /context # Context API for managing favorites
â”œâ”€â”€ /hooks # Custom hooks (network status, API fetching, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ /screens # Main screens (Home, Favorites, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ /assets # Images and icons

ðŸš€ Approach & Optimizations

âœ… State Management

- useState & useEffect for local component state.
- Context API to manage and persist favorite products.
  âœ… API Performance
- Debounce prevents excessive API calls when searching.
- Pagination & Caching improve performance.
  âœ… Offline & Error Handling
- useNetInfo to detect connectivity status.
- Retry button when an API request fails.
